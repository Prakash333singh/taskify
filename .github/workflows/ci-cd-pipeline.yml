    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code from the repository
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20.x' # Specify the Node.js version from package.json

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Linting and Testing
      # You can add more tests or linters as needed
      # - name: Run Linting (Optional)
      #   run: npm run lint

      # - name: Run Tests (Optional)
      #   run: npm test

      # Step 5: Build the application
      - name: Build the Application
        run: npm run build

      # Step 6: Deploy the application (Optional, for example, deploy to Heroku)
      # This step can be added for deployment purposes
      # - name: Deploy to Heroku (or any other platform)
      #   run: |
      #     echo "Deploying the application..."
      #     # Add deployment steps here (e.g., heroku deploy command)

  # Optionally, you can add a separate deployment job
  # deploy:
  #   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  #   needs: build
  #   steps:
  #     - name: Deploy to a hosting service (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku, etc.)
  #       run: |
  #         echo "Deploying..."
